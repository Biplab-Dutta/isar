# now_in_dart_flutter

This is an app developed for every flutter developer to remain updated with the changes happening around Dart and Flutter ecosystem. The app displays **Dart's Changelogs**, **Flutter's What's new**, and **Release Notes**. The information is gathered from official Dart and Flutter's GithHub repository and uses official GitHub's API to retrieve all the contents in HTML format which is then consumed by WebView in the app. For offline mode, the app uses **Isar** as its database.
